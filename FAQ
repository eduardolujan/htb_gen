Q1: The bandwidth distribution seems to does not work at all
A1: -Check that htb classes are working
     tc -s class show dev $iface
     watch -n1 -d "tc -s class show dev $iface |egrep -A4 $class" 
     #where $iface is the iface you are looking for
     #and $class is the class you are looking for
     
     Or you can download jjo's htb-stats.sh script. It will show 
     real time bandwidth usage per class/host in a very fancy way.

    -Check that the iptables rules are appling and the packets get marked
     iptables -t mangle -F #to be shure you dont have any rule that conflict
     htb-gen iptables_only  #re-insert the firwall rules
     iptables -t mangle -nvL FORWARD 
     watch -n1 -d "iptables -t mangle -nvL $host.down"
     watch -n1 -d "iptables -t mangle -nvL $host.up"
     #where $host is the host your are looking for
   
    -Chek that you haven't LIED in your 
     'total_rate_down' and 'total_rate_up' settings
     Or that your internet provider have doesn't.
     Try reduce the total_rates vars and check again. Wired things can happen
     if htb thinks that he has more bw than real.
